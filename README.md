# XIV-BiStro-Client

This is the front-end for the XIV BiStro app, an app which allows users to create and view their own tables for what their Best in Slot gear is and which pieces they already have in Final Fantasy XIV Online. The code in this repository formats and displays the data stored in the database on a sleekly designed React web page for use by end users.

## Technologies Used

AAU I want to be able to:

- Update gear in the current gear table as I obtain new pieces

### Icebox User Stories
AAU I want to be able to:
